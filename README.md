# digit-recognition-neural-network
A neural network for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The model uses a simple feedforward architecture with ReLU activation for the hidden layer and softmax for the output layer. Trained with gradient descent, it predicts digits from 28x28 grayscale images with high accuracy.
